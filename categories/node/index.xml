      <description>I was recently learning about browser-based game development and was wondering about multiplayer games. WebSockets are super easy to work with but are they any good for games? The answer is yes and no. If you make a turn-based thing that doesn&amp;rsquo;t require up to the millisecond updates then WebSockets are the way to go, but for any fast-paced games they&amp;rsquo;re just not up to scratch.
WebSockets are built on TCP, a reliable messaging protocol that ensures all data arrives and that it arrives in order.</description>
