      <description>Javascript is quite a loose language, its possible to do things in a bunch of different ways. This tends to lead to developers coding themselves into a corner with custom patterns that seem clunky.
Below are a few of the patterns that are often seen in Javascript development, use these as a reference if you&amp;rsquo;re unsure about how to write a Javascript module.
The module.exports property and the require function are found in either Node.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a lot of Coffeescript lately. For a long time I avoided it, it looked all weird and scary but, once I finally bit the bullet, I realised its actually a rather pretty language.
Below I&amp;rsquo;ve highlighted some of my favourite parts of Coffeescript but it is in no way a complete guide. To learn more about Coffeescript, check out the excellent homepage at http://coffeescript.org/. You will find a detailed list of features, along with their Javascript alternatives, and also a neat sandbox for trying out the language and immediately seeing the output Javascript.</description>
